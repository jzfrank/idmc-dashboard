      "City of Napa planning to clear homeless encampments near Maxwell Bridge",
    text: "The city of Napa is planning to clear homeless encampments near the Maxwell Bridge later this month, in a move reminiscent of last year\u2019s cleanup of the nearby former encampment area known as The Bowl, amid a rise in local complaints about homelessness.\n\nAs with last year, the city is timing the encampment removal to coincide with the partial opening of the Napa winter shelter to make sure, with legal considerations in mind, that the homeless residents there have somewhere to go. The residents will also be provided with private storage, through Abode Services, the homeless services provider for Napa County.\n\nMolly Rattigan, the city\u2019s point person on homelessness, said the winter shelter will open on Nov. 21 for residents of the Maxwell Bridge encampment and Nov. 28 for everyone else.\n\nQuality journalism doesn't happen without your help. Subscribe today! Support local news coverage and the people who report it by subscribing to the Napa Valley Register.\n\n\u201cThe Bowl has remained relatively clean and clear,\u201d Rattigan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the area surrounding it, particularly over by the Hampton Inn and the Maxwell Bridge to the Fosters Freeze that have been rebuilt over the past year.\u201d\n\nThe city is required by law to give a 72-hour notice to residents before the encampment clearing commences; they\u2019ll be providing a 13-day notice on Nov. 15. During the time before the cleanup, Rattigan said, homeless services staff will work to figure out who lives in the encampment and who hangs out there, in preparation for the cleanup on Nov. 28.\n\nAlso similar to last year\u2019s cleanup, the city is leading the effort, with the collaboration of property ownership interests in the area. That includes CalTrans, which historically has cleared Maxwell Bridge encampments several times, but has not consistently kept the area clear. The city\u2019s cleanup will make way for a pilot program they\u2019re working on with CalTrans to be able to enter their property and provide services to homeless residents instead of relying on CalTrans to manage the property.\n\nRattigan noted that the city\u2019s priority is helping the people in the encampments. To the city, she said, that means bringing them in out of the dropping temperatures and rain, in part because doing so brings them into engagement with homeless service programs, which theoretically brings them into the process of being housed in a permanent supportive housing unit.\n\nCity Manager Steve Potter also said complaints from city residents about homelessness have been increasing throughout the city, especially in areas near the Maxwell Bridge.\n\n\u201cThe community, their sentiment has changed,\u201d Potter said. \u201cThey want us, the city, to take action.\u201d\n\nRattigan added that the city takes public safety in mind when deciding whether to clear an encampment. In the last 90 days or so, she said, there have been 28 calls for fire or emergency medical services from that area, with five involving an actual fire. Additionally, four sexual assaults have been reported in the area in the past 30 days, and police are often called to the area to generally address issues, Rattigan said.\n\nRattigan also noted that the city\u2019s intent is to eventually bring all encampment residents indoors, but the city doesn\u2019t have the bed capacity available to legally justify clearing all the encampments for that purpose.\n\nRattigan noted that roughly 100 new units of permanent supportive housing \u2014 from the Valley Lodge Apartments and Heritage House projects \u2014 will become available specifically for homeless residents next year, including a few residents currently living in the Maxwell Bridge encampments The city is also continuing to pursue state opportunities to fund such housing and homeless response efforts.\n\n\u201cWe realize we can\u2019t close and clear everything right now, all at once, but our ultimate goal is to eventually close and clear and have people indoors, and accessing the space and programs that are available\u201d Rattigan said.",

    text: "The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in Libya welcomed last Thursday a contribution of approx. US$ 355,000) from the Czech Republic to support the rehabilitation of the Food and Drug Control Centre (FDCC) laboratory in Benghazi. Through this project, WFP aims to provide the centre with advanced equipment and technical training to improve its capacity.\n\nAs a legal body entrusted with the authority to regulate the safety and quality of food and medicine, the FDCC plays a key role in ensuring that all imported food and drugs meet the Libyan standard specifications, WFP explained.\n\nLibya imports 80 percent of its food consumption requirements, and up to 90 percent of its cereal requirements. The main staple foods imported are wheat flour, maize oil and milk, corresponding to about 40 percent of all agricultural products imported, it added.\n\n\u201cWFP is extremely grateful to the Government of the Czech Republic for this generous contribution, coming at a crucial time in a world struggling with the impacts of COVID-19 and the conflict in Ukraine,\u201d said Maysaa AlGhribawy, WFP\u2019s Representative and Country Director in Libya.\n\nThe Czech support to the Benghazi FDCC follows a previous contribution to WFP for the rehabilitation of the main FDCC in Tripoli which helped WFP to fully upgrade the Centre\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cAccess to safe food and medicine is a basic right of citizens and requires well-resourced reference laboratories, said Jan Vy\u010d\u00edtal, the Ambassador of the Czech Republic to Libya and Tunisia. \u201cThe Czech Republic is glad to contribute to the FDCC fulfilling its important role both in Tripoli and Benghazi, the two main entry points of all imports.\u201d\n\nBoth Czech contributions allow WFP to support the Libyan government in its mission to ensure the circulation of healthy food and medicine across the country, while empowering key staff through technical training.\n\nThe centres were established as independent entities with a legal character, entrusted with all the procedural, executive, and supervisory tasks carried out by existing authorities to ensure the safety of food and medicine for humans and animals, in a context where market functionality has been greatly affected by global supply chain disruptions.",

      "CBP head Chris Magnus has resigned, following standoff with DHS secretary",
    text: "U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Chris Magnus resigned late Saturday, the White House said in a short statement, ending an awkward standoff between the country's top border official and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nMayorkas asked Magnus to step down on Wednesday but the CBP commissioner refused to go quietly, insisting would not leave unless asked by the White House.\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden accepted Magnus's resignation, \"and appreciates his nearly forty years of service and the contributions he made to police reform during his tenure as police chief in three U.S. cities.\"\n\nIn a statement to The Post, Magnus said the decision \"provides me with the best path for advancing my commitment to professional, innovative, and community-engaged policing.\"\n\nThe White House also published a copy of a letter from Magnus thanking Biden for his opportunity to serve \"over the past year.\" But Magnus lasted just 11 months in the job. He was confirmed by the Senate last December in a vote largely along party lines.\n\nMagnus, 62, was picked by the White House to lead the country's largest law enforcement agency after building a reputation as a leading law enforcement reformer during tenures as police chief in Fargo, N.D., Richmond, Calif. and Tucson He was CBP's first openly gay commissioner.\n\nYet Magnus's ambitions to overhaul CBP put him at odds with Mayorkas and senior CBP leaders struggling to contend with record numbers of migrant arrests along the Mexico border.\n\nMagnus said he sought to make changes to policies governing high-speed vehicle pursuits, staff overtime practices as well as CBP officer inspections of travelers' cellphones at border crossings, among other reform ideas. Those efforts were stymied, he said.\n\n\"I didn't take this job as a resume builder. I came to Washington, D.C. - moved my family here - because I care about this agency, its mission, and the goals of this Administration,\" Magnus said while defying attempts to oust him.\n\nMagnus said he tried repeatedly to bring much-needed changes to CBP, but Mayorkas did not welcome disruptions, and was more attuned to the needs of career officials coping with the strains at the border.\n\nAccording to Magnus, tensions peaked Wednesday after Magnus traveled to El Paso to attend a meeting of the Border Patrol sector chiefs. Mayorkas had asked him not to go. Magnus said Mayorkas then asked for his resignation during a videoconference, telling Magnus that he and CBP staff had lost confidence in him and that Magnus had disobeyed him by traveling to El Paso.\n\nDeputy CBP commissioner Troy Miller will serve as the agency's acting leader, Mayorkas said in an email to CBP staff sent late Saturday. Miller ran CBP as its interim leader during much of 2021.",

    text: "Housing insecurity is something that impacts far too much of the world, but here in New York State, homelessness is impacting one vulnerable group in particular. A recent study provided statistics indicating that New York has the most students without consistent and adequate housing in the country. Here's a deeper look.\n\nNew York State Ranked 50th in Recent Study of Students Experiencing Homelessness\n\nAs defined by the percentage of public school students who lack a fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence, a recent study from the Department of Education and National Center for Homeless Education has found New York to be the 'least healthy state' when it comes to students experiencing homelessness. The U.S. Value, or average for the ranking came in at a 2.5%, with Connecticut coming in as the healthiest state with a 0.8% ranking, and New York coming in at number 50, with a 5.3% ranking.\n\nCanva Canva loading...\n\nAmerica's Health Rankings, who published the information about the homelessness rates goes onto detail that it isn't solely children in families that are 'cost-burdened' or living in poverty that make up the homeless population, but also those in homes with domestic violence as well.\n\nImpact of the Student Homeless Population in New York, & Measures To Help\n\nA recent story in the New York Times cited that in the New York City public school system alone, there were more than 104,000 homeless students last year, a 3% increase from the year before. That number did not include any migrant students that recently came to NY from Texas.\n\nThe pandemic was said to be a major factor impacting the number of homeless students in the state, but even just prior, during the 2019-2020 school year, there were more than 1.2 million students across the U.S. identified by schools as homeless. In 2020, 34,210 were 34,210 unaccompanied youth under the age of 25 experiencing homelessness that year; 9.9% of whom were children under 18, this according to America's Health Rankings.\n\nGet our free mobile app\n\nIt should come as no surprise that for those students who are homeless, or have instability in their home lives, school tends to be their safe place. School is a place where these students feel they belong, provides a schedule and meals, and a caring environment. A number of staff within the Department of Education, according to the New York Times, about 350 or so, work specifically for students with homelessness, but the help can't just come from the schools alone. Partnerships between school services, community and government response agencies to provide not only support, but early intervention and prevention systems are necessary in addressing, and hopefully ending homelessness and housing insecurity.\n\nHudson Valley Charities You Can Feel Good About Supporting Reputable Hudson Valley Charities",

    text: "At first glance, Daniel Andrews\u2019 choice to use a 1998 club hit, Sing It Back, for his big entrance to Labor\u2019s campaign launch on Sunday was a little odd, given it is laced with sexual innuendo and the premier is a renowned 1980s rock fan.\n\nBut as he walked on to the stage to the lyrics \u201cbring it back\u201d, it became clear it was a nod to Labor\u2019s commitment to bring back the State Electricity Commission (SEC) if elected on 26 November.\n\nThe commitment was central to the launch, with members of the Electrical Trades Union arriving at Cranbourne Community Theatre in T-shirts featuring the SEC\u2019s old sun-ray logo. The deputy premier, Jacinta Allan, dedicated her entire speech to it.\n\nAllan told the crowd her father began his 50-year career in the electricity sector with an apprenticeship with the SEC, which at the time was Victoria\u2019s sole provider of electricity generation, transmission and networks.\n\n\u201cFor a young person back then, working for the SEC meant a job for life. Secure, stable work, the kind of work you could raise a family on, build a life with,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBack then, each community and country town had its own SEC depot, each local depot employed its own local workers and each year a couple of extra apprentices would be taken on.\u201d\n\nAllan went on to criticise its privatisation by the former Kennett Liberal government in the 1990s, a decision she said had failed workers and country communities and driven up power bills for Victorians. The latest federal budget predicted electricity prices were expected to rise by 56% over the next two years and gas prices by 40%.\n\nLabor also announced another power-saving bonus of $250 for households who seek a better power deal via a government website.\n\nThe other new announcement was a $207m package for specialist schools.\n\nBut the SEC dominated Andrews speech, with the premier describing its revival as \u201can opportunity for generations of Victorians\u201d \u2013 6,000 jobs for the commission will be dedicated to apprentices and local content requirements would guarantee them a pipeline of work \u2013 while framing the election as a choice between privatisation and public ownership.\n\nThe opposition leader, Matthew Guy, on Sunday mocked the government\u2019s SEC commitment as taking Victoria \u201cback to 1975\u201d with \u201cno evidence it will actually lower energy bills\u201d.\n\nStrategists, however, have said the policy is getting the most cut-through of all of Labor\u2019s election commitments so far. It appeals to older voters, who remember the simpler times that Allan revisited in her speech, and younger voters, who in an era of job instability and short-term employment contracts would find the possibility of working for one company for decades an attractive proposition.\n\nThis was embodied in a slick campaign video produced for the launch, featuring \u201cmates\u201d Graham and Mick, who spoke of the \u201cgood old days\u201d of the SEC \u2013 both worked more than 20 years for the commission before it was privatised \u2013 and then Damien, James and Shannon, who work in the industry now.\n\n\u201cWe go from one contract to another and it doesn\u2019t really enable you to plan and be secure as far as your financial situation goes,\u201d Damien says in the video.\n\nIt also appeals to those who want a faster transition to renewables (read: voters who may be considering backing the Greens in Labor-held seats in the inner city) as well as workers, who are being told they won\u2019t be left behind.\n\nSign up to Guardian Australia's Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Guy spoke about rebuilding Victoria\u2019s burdened healthcare system, easing cost-of-living pressures on families, the state\u2019s growing debt and the integrity cloud over the government.\n\nGuests were handed \u201cfrequent-liar\u201d cards, a nod to the several Ibac investigations that have played out during Andrews\u2019 time as premier. But outside, a small group of protesters in lobster suits sought to remind voters the Coalition also hasn\u2019t covered itself in glory on the issue of integrity \u2013 referring to 2017 revelation Guy dined at Beaumaris Lobstercave with an alleged mafia boss.\n\nGuy announced the Coalition would cover electricity supply charges on power bills for the first six months of 2023, saving households an estimated $235, and promised that all new gas produced in Victoria would be quarantined for Victorian use. But his focus was on the government weaknesses and the challenge ahead. To win outright, the Coalition needs a net gain of 18 seats. Adding to its woes, it will enter the race in a worse position than it was then, thanks to an electoral redistribution that sees Labor gain two net seats, based on the 2018 vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like climbing Mount Everest without oxygen and here in Victoria, Labor have been in government for 19 of the past 23 years, it\u2019s like doing it all in a blizzard \u2013 all backwards,\u201d Guy said.\n\n\u201cBut for the sake of all those people impacted by Daniel Andrews and his world-record lockdowns, we must win this election.\u201d\n\nGuy said there was a \u201cgrowing wave of anger and resentment\u201d against the premier in the state that makes him \u201cmore and more confident\u201d that the Coalition will win the election.\n\nHe has two more weeks to make his case.",

    text: 'Police works at the scene after an explosion on busy pedestrian Istiklal street in Istanbul, Turkiye, November 13, 2022. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nAt least six people died while 53 others were wounded on Sunday when an explosion rocked a busy pedestrian street in central Istanbul in what Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called a \u201cvile\u201d bomb attack that \u201csmells like terrorism\u201d.\n\nThe explosion occurred shortly after 4pm in the famous Istiklal shopping street which is popular with locals and tourists. According to images posted on social media at the time of the explosion, it was accompanied by flames and immediately triggered panic, with people running in all directions.\n\nA large black crater was also visible in those images, as well as several bodies lying on the ground nearby. According to an AFP video journalist on the scene, police established a large security cordon to prevent access to the damaged area for fear of a second explosion.\n\nThe area, in the Beyoglu district of Turkey\u2019s largest city, had been crowded as usual at the weekend with shoppers, tourists and families. Reuters footage showed people attending to victims after the blast, and later investigators in white outfits collecting material from the scene.\n\nA massive deployment of security forces equally barred all entrances, while a heavy deployment of rescue workers and police were visible. A helicopter flew above the scene and a number of ambulances were parked in nearby Taksim Square.\n\n\u201cI was 50-55 metres (yards) away, suddenly there was the noise of an explosion. I saw three or four people on the ground,\u201d witness Cemal Denizci, 57, told AFP. \u201cPeople were running in panic. The noise was huge. There was black smoke,\u201d he said.\n\nErdogan told a press conference that initial information suggested \u201ca woman played a part\u201d in the bombing. "It might be wrong if we say for sure that this is terror but according to first signs... there is a smell of terror there," he added.\n\n\u201cOur people can rest assured that the culprits behind the attack will be punished as they deserve,\u201d he said. \u201cEfforts to defeat Turkey and the Turkish people through terrorism will fail today just as they did yesterday and as they will again tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAuthorities offered few details and no groups immediately claimed the blast, but Turkish cities in the past have been struck by militant and Kurdish groups. Istiklal Avenue had already been hit in the past during a campaign of attacks in 2015 and 2016 that targeted Istanbul and other cities, including the capital Ankara.\n\nCondemnations of the attack and condolences for the victims rolled in from several countries, including Pakistan, Greece, Egypt, Ukraine and Azerbaijan. President Dr Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed their condolences to Turkiye over loss of precious lives in Istanbul blast.\n\n\u201cI have learnt with deep anguish about the explosion at popular Istiklal avenue in the heart of Istanbul. Govt & people of Pakistan express deepest condolences to the brotherly people of Turkiye at the loss of precious lives & send prayers for the speedy recovery of the injured,\u201d Shehbaz posted a tweet.\n\nPresident Alvi strongly condemned the explosion and expressed solidarity with the government and people of Turkiye over the incident. He said that they shared grief with the people of Turkiye. He added that terrorism was a collective issue of the world.\n\nForeign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said he was deeply saddened at loss of precious life. \u201cWe stand in complete solidarity with our Turkish brethren in this hour of grief and offer our sincerest condolences to the bereaved families & brotherly people of Turkiye,\u201d he said.\n\nGreece "unequivocally" condemned the blast and expressed condolences to the government and people of Turkey. European Council President Charles Michel said on Twitter he had sent condolences to victims after the \u201chorrific news\u201d.',

    title: "Bay: Guam: The hinge of America's pacific defense begins",
    text: "The people of Guam say \u201cAmerica\u2019s day begins\u201d when the sun shines on their island.\n\nThat Chamber of Commerce claim is geographically and politically accurate. Guam, in the western Pacific east of the Philippines and north of New Guinea, is sovereign U.S. territory on the bright side of the International Date Line.\n\nIn 2022, sunrise on U.S. citizens in Polynesia isn\u2019t the only reason Guam is unique and very valuable American terrain.\n\nThe politics: Observe the aggressive and imperialist behavior of communist China in Asia and in the western Pacific.\n\nGo to the world map: Guam is indeed America. Since the island is America, it ought to be covered by NATO\u2019s Article 5. That means: Attack Guam and the attacker is at war with 30 of the world\u2019s most powerful and wealthy nations. In a few months, even Sweden!\n\nNATO Article 5, however, doesn\u2019t cover Guam nor Hawaii.\n\nIn July 2022 I wrote a column about this grievous strategic error that said NATO must include Hawaii and Guam under its powerful shield. Why? To deter Xi Jinping\u2019s China from attacking Taiwan and South Korea.\n\n2022 is a late date to address the Chinese and North Korean threat to Guam.\n\nIn 1993 I wrote a guest column for a Texas newspaper that analyzed the post-Cold War \u201cpeace dividend.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t recall the peace dividend, that\u2019s understandable. There was no peace to enjoy. But in 1993 the Clinton administration thought Russia was kaput, so it sought cutbacks in U.S. defense expenditures.\n\nMy 1993 essay asked a specific question: What bases should the US continue to man?\n\nFrom that column: \u201cPearl Harbor commands the Pacific. Guam is the near-perfect place to put a strategic airbase for operations against the Asian coast.\u201d\n\nGeography has not changed. Like, rock and coral are real.\n\nFrom the 1993 essay: \u201cDoes reducing U.S. foreign bases run the risk of \u2018putting the eggs in one basket\u2019 and creating an easy target for a regional thug with a handful of ballistic missiles and nukes? A recent North Korean defector pegged U.S. bases in Japan and Guam as prime targets for a North Korean ICBM.\u201d\n\nCredit then-Secretary of Defense Les Aspin with recommending an anti-missile missile shield to protect \u201cthese valuable point targets.\u201d\n\nWell, give geography and SecDef Aspin an A-plus. The latest U.S. National Defense Strategy (NDS) called Guam \u201ca crucial operational base\u201d to \u201cuphold a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\u201d Indo-Pacific means everything on Earth from California to Mumbai (Bombay) and the Arabian Sea.\n\nThe NDS added that Guam is a vital power projection and logistical base and if an enemy attacks Guam \u201cit will be seen as a direct attack on the U.S.\u201d\n\nYours truly translating for Xi: Washington is signaling Guam is not just America, it is de facto NATO.\n\nThe NDS directs the U.S. military budget. Right now, $1 billion is devoted to defending Guam against air and missile attack. Additional Pentagon funds will improve Guam\u2019s naval base and Andersen Air Force Base.\n\nThe Navy wants to expand its ability to support American nuclear submarines and allied conventional subs and ensure its ability to support Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and Singapore.\n\nThe Army has money to \u201ctailor\u201d anti-missile missile units \u2014 initially Patriot and THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Air Defense) missile units.\n\nThe goal: Build by 2026 what a former U.S. Indo-Pacific Command commander called a \u201c360-degree defense of Guam\u201d that protects the island \u201cagainst advanced Chinese cruise, ballistic and maneuvering hypersonic weapons.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re not going to take it. Guam has a key role in an American offense. From Guam USAF heavy bombers can lay sea mines that pin Chinese ships in coastal harbors and deny them shore facilities. They can do so in time to save Taiwan.\n\nGuam supports submarine operations that help air power pin Chinese ships. Guam is a forward supply point for U.S. and Australian subs \u2014 and Japanese as well. Mines along China\u2019s coast don\u2019t just hinder China\u2019s navy. They strangle the maritime leg of China\u2019s Africa and Southwest Asia resource-driven economy.",

The new order has given permission to Divya Pharmacy to continue producing the five medicines.\n\nAfter repeated violation of the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisement) Act by Ramdev\u2019s Divya Pharmacy, the authorities had asked the company to stop the production of BPgrit, Madhugrit, Thyrogrit, Lipidom and Eyegrit Gold tablets. These drugs were being promoted as cures for these diseases blood pressure,diabetes, goitre, high cholesterol and glaucoma respectively.\n\nThe state drugs regulator for Ayurveda and Unani medicine had taken this action against the Divya Pharmacy following a complaint filed by Kerala-based ophthalmologist Dr KV Babu. The Kerala-based doctor had said the drugs for treatment of glaucoma advertised by Divya Pharmacy may pose a threat to eyesight.\n\nThe state drugs regulator for Ayurveda and Unani medicine issued an amended order on Saturday allowing the firm to resume production of these medicines.

    title: "Call for Irish neutrality and peace to be restored",
    text: "Peace activists from around the country will gather at Shannon this afternoon to protest against the continuing US military use of the airport.\n\nThe event takes place two days after Armistice Day which is intended to mark the end of fighting in World War I and to honour the war dead. It will draw attention to how little peace there is in the world today and how Ireland\u2019s increasing support for militarization is escalating global instability .\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nArmed US troops pass through Shannon on a daily basis, despite the fact that the country claims to be neutral.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening at Shannon Airport is in breach of international laws on neutrality and makes the Irish people complicity in US war crimes and torture\u201d said Edward Horgan of Shannonwatch. The group have been protesting at the airport on the second Sunday of every month since 2008, but say that the human and financial costs of the military movements through Shannon are escalating.\n\n\u201cMany people are under the false impression that Ireland is gaining financially from US military use of Shannon Airport\u201d said Edward Horgan. \u201cThe opposite is the case. The small profit made from refuelling warplanes and providing refreshments for US soldiers is dwarfed by the additional costs incurred over the past twenty years by Irish taxpayers.\n\n\u201cAdded to that there are the costs associated with the unjustified prosecutions of dozens of peace activists, many of whom were acquitted by the courts. Security and other costs for the visit by US President GW Bush in 2004 may have cost up to \u20ac20 million, so the total direct and indirect costs incurred by the Irish State due to US military use of Shannon Airport may have exceeded \u20ac100 million.\u201d\n\nHowever these financial costs are far less significant than the costs in human lives and suffering caused by US led wars in the Middle East and Africa, as well as the costs in environmental and infrastructural damage.\n\n\u201cUp to 5 million people have died due to war related reasons across the wider Middle East since the first Gulf war in 1991. This included over one million children whose lives were destroyed, and in whose deaths, we have been actively complicit. Wars waged in the Middle East by the US and their NATO and other allies since the first Gulf War have been in breach of the UN Charter, the Hague and Geneva conventions and other international and national laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow Russia has joined the international law breakers by waging a dreadful war in Ukraine. This has had devastating impact on the people of Ukraine. It has also become a proxy war for resources between Russia and the US-dominated NATO. And in this context, the ongoing US military use of Shannon Airport could make Ireland a target for Russian military retaliation.\u201d\n\nLike others, Shannonwatch are hugely concerned that if nuclear weapons are used in the war, or nuclear power stations are attacked, the consequences for humanity could be catastrophic. The Irish government has failed to use its two-year membership of the UN Security Council to avert this danger, and to instead promote international peace and justice.\n\nSeveral opinion polls demonstrate that most Irish people support active Irish neutrality, yet successive Irish governments since 2001 have eroded Irish neutrality and have involved Ireland in unjustified wars and military alliances.\n\nNoting the significance of the date of the protest at Shannon airport, Shannonwatch note that Armistice Day purports to celebrate the heroes who died in World War 1, saying they died so that the world could live in peace, but that there has been little peace since. Up to 50,000 Irish men died in World War 1 which instead of creating peace was itself a cause of World War 2, the Holocaust, and US use of atomic bombs against Japan. International peace is as far from reality today as it was in 1914 and 1939.\n\nShannonwatch calls on the Irish people to restore Ireland\u2019s active neutrality by prohibiting the use of Shannon and other Irish airports and seaports by US, NATO and other foreign military forces,\u201d the organisation has said.",

A letter initiated by a senator accompanied by Joyland\u2019s rather tabooed themes of trans love may just end up working against its Pakistan release.\n\nOn Saturday, Jamaat-e-Islami Senator Mushtaq Ahmed tweeted a letter initiated by the Ministry of Information and Broadcast that deemed the previously certified film \u2018uncertified\u2019.\n\n\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u062f\u0644\u0644\u06c1! @GovtofPakistan\n\n\u0646\u06d2\u0645\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0632\u0639 \u0641\u0644\u0645 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0626\u06d2\u0644\u06cc\u0646\u0688\u06a9\u0648\u062c\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u06c1 \u0646\u0645\u0627\u0626\u0634 \u06a9\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0633\u0646\u0633 \u0645\u0646\u0633\u0648\u062e \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u06cc\u0627\u06c1\u06d2\u06d4\u0646\u0648\u0679\u06cc\u0641\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc\u0634\u0646 \u062c\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u060c\u06cc\u06c1 \u062d\u06a9\u0648\u0645\u062a \u06a9\u0627\u0627\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0627\u0642\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u06c1\u06d2\u06d4\u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u0645\u0645\u0644\u06a9\u062a \u06c1\u06d2\u06cc\u06c1\u0627\u06ba \u06a9\u0648\u0626\u06cc \u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646\u060c \u06a9\u0648\u0626\u06cc \u0627\u0642\u062f\u0627\u0645\u060c\u06a9\u0648\u0626\u06cc \u0646\u0638\u0631\u06cc\u06c1 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0650 \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0646\u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0686\u0644 \u0633\u06a9\u062a\u0627\u06d4#BanJoyland pic.twitter.com/tib00zo6Dd \u2014 Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan (@SenatorMushtaq) November 12, 2022\n\n\u201cWhereas on the release of the film, written complaints were received that film contains highly objectionable material, which does not conform with the social values and moral standards of our society and is clearly repugnant to the norms of decency and morality as laid in Section 9 of Motion Picture Ordinance 1979,\u201d stated the letter. \u201cIt also mentioned that the \u2018uncertification\u2019 of the film applies to cinemas across Pakistan that fall under the jurisdiction of CBFC( Central Board of Film Certification).\u201d\n\nThe letter shared by Ahmed raises two important questions; first of all, it cites complaints that were received following the \u2018release of the film\u2019 whereas the film is actually scheduled to release in Pakistan on November 18. Who saw the film apart from the censor boards and raised the complaints has not been explained.\n\nSecondly, after the 18th amendment the CBFC\u2019s jurisdiction has been limited to ICT (Islamabad Capital Territory), cantonment areas across the country and provinces that don\u2019t haven\u2019t formed their own boards yet, i.e KP and Balochistan.\n\nIt is also pertinent to mention here that the film was certified for release by all the censor boards with minor objections and edits recommended for public screening. If the content of this letter is indeed executed then it would mean that the Federal government is overriding the decision made by the provincial censor boards.\n\nWhat censor boards have to say\n\nWhile the chairman of Sindh Censor Board, Khalid Bin Shaheen did not respond to The Express Tribune\u2019s calls or messages, sources close to the board revealed that some members were initially skeptical about the content of the film and were not fully sure how the audiences will respond to a love story between a man and a trans person but they eventually did certify the film.\n\n\u201cYes, it has been passed and certified with edits that have been conveyed to the producers and we are not sure of any other development so far,\u201d the source told the publication.\n\nA Punjab censor board official also confirmed the same. \u201cWe are not aware of any letter issued by the government. From our end, the film has been certified and ready for release,\u201d said the official while requesting anonymity.\n\nOn the other hand, Distribution Club, the company responsible for distributing Joyland in Pakistan is trying its best to reach a middle ground. \u201cYes, we have received a letter from CBFC to stop the release of the film but nothing directly from the government or the provincial boards as such. The film has already been certified and is ready for release and we are 90% sure that the Pakistani audiences will get to watch Joyland,\u201d said the Distribution Club official.\n\nLone warrior?\n\nLast week, Senator Ahmed urged the PDM-led government to stop the release of Joyland in Pakistan because of the \u2018anti-Islam\u2019 values it promotes.\n\n\u067e\u06cc \u0688\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0645 \u062d\u06a9\u0648\u0645\u062a \u06a9\u0627\u06c1\u0645 \u062c\u0646\u0633 \u067e\u0631\u0633\u062a\u06cc \u06a9\u06d2\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0627\u063a \u067e\u0631\u0645\u0628\u0646\u06cc \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0633\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0688\u06cc\u0627\u0641\u062a\u06c1 \u0641\u0644\u0645 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0626\u06d2\u0644\u06cc\u0646\u0688\u06a9\u06cc \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u0646\u0645\u0627\u0626\u0634 \u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u062c\u0627\u0632\u062a \u06a9\u06cc \u0645\u0630\u0645\u062a \u06a9\u0631\u062a\u0627\u06c1\u0648\u06ba\u060c\u0627\u0633 \u0641\u0644\u0645 \u06a9\u06cc \u0646\u0645\u0627\u0626\u0634 \u0631\u0648\u06a9\u0646\u06d2\u060c\u0639\u0648\u0627\u0645 \u06a9\u0648\u0622\u06af\u0627\u06c1 \u06a9\u0631\u0646\u06d2\u06a9\u06d2 \u0644\u06cc\u06d2\u06c1\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0626\u0632/\u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646\u06cc \u0630\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0639 \u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u0646\u06af\u06d2\u06d4\u06cc\u06c1 \u0641\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u060c\u06c1\u0645\u0627\u0631\u06d2\u0645\u0644\u06a9 \u06a9\u06d2\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0634\u0631\u062a\u06cc \u0627\u0642\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06a9\u06d2\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0646\u06af \u06c1\u06d2\u06d4#Joyland #queer pic.twitter.com/cMo1Qv8mxQ \u2014 Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan (@SenatorMushtaq) November 3, 2022\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Trans love story that has already won the Queer Palm award at the Cannes Film Festival and has been lauded for the LGBT themes it explores. This is nothing short of an anti-Islamic attack on the institutions of Nikkah and marriage, the Information Ministry must immediately stop the film from releasing in Pakistan,\u201d Ahmed said in the video.\n\nThe cast speaks out\n\nTeam Joyland, including Alina Khan, Rasti Farooq and Abdullah Siddiqui took to social media and shared a note regarding the apparent ban on their film.\n\n"They\'re doing it again! There are smear campaigns to ban Joyland," the statement read. Calling it a dark day for all artists in Pakistan, the note further read, "We need your support to make sure we don\'t let these violent, insensitive, extremists win again." The team further appealed that the audience lends support to the film by tweeting #ReleaseJoyland on Twitter.\n\nAdding on, the statement read, "#BanJoyland has been trending in Pakistan on number three because these people are doing a paid smear campaign. But we are going to count on you all to organically trend #ReleaseJoyland." The statement concluded with, "Pakistani artists deserve better. When will this hooliganism end?"\n\nSarwat Gilani took to the micro-blogging website and shared while tagging the Ministry of Information and Broadcast\'s official handle, There\u2019s a paid smear campaign doing rounds against Joyland, a film that made history for Pakistani cinema, got passed by all censor boards but now authorities are caving in to pressure from some malicious people who have not even seen the film."\n\nThere\u2019s a paid smear campaign doing rounds against #Joyland, a film that made history for Pakistani cinema, got passed by all censor boards but now authorities are caving into pressure from some malicious people who have not even seen the film. #ReleaseJoyland @MoIB_Official \u2014 sarwat gilani (@sarwatgilani) November 12, 2022\n\nContinuing, the Churails actor added, "Shameful that a Pakistani film made by 200 Pakistanis over six years that got standing ovations from Toronto to Cairo to Cannes is being hindered in its own country.

The Balu Mahi star, while tagging the Ministry of Information and Broadcast\'s official handle, wrote, "Can you please confirm the authenticity of this letter (shared by a member of the Senate), because if Joyland has been declared an uncertified film, I\'ve got some questions."\n\nTo the @MoIB_Official:\n\nCan you please confirm the authenticity of this letter (shared by a member of Senate), because if Joyland has been declared an uncertified film, I\'ve got some questions.\n\n/cont\'d. pic.twitter.com/YqnVjuGymF \u2014 Osman Khalid Butt (@aClockworkObi) November 12, 2022\n\nHe continued, "The CFBC cleared Joyland for release in August.

    title: "Migrant rescue ship docks in French port amid Italy rift",
    text: "A maritime rescue ship docked Friday in a southern French port carrying 230 migrants whose fates have sparked a diplomatic row between France and Italy \u2014 a dispute that\u2019s threatening EU efforts to share around asylum-seekers.\n\nThe French welcome for the Ocean Viking, though reluctant, unleashed fury from far-right rivals of the French government. Migrant advocates expressed relief, but lamented that it took weeks to find a harbor for the ship as Italy refused to let it dock, and vowed Friday to send their vessels back out to the Mediterranean to save others in distress.\n\nThe Ocean Viking disembarked its passengers at the Toulon port. people from Eritrea, Egypt, Syria, Bangladesh, Pakistan and other nations, including 44 unaccompanied minors and children as young as 3.\n\nTwo dozen needed medical care and one was hospitalized, the Var regional administration said Friday. All underwent security checks and most were sent to temporary lodging in the Mediterranean resort of Giens. The unaccompanied minors were taken to a separate, undisclosed location, it said.\n\nAll those taken to the processing center wanted to seek asylum, and immigration officials will start the interview process Saturday, the statement said.\n\nSome who disembarked Friday had been rescued in the Mediterranean Sea as long as three weeks ago.\n\nThe ship became the cause of a rift between France and Italy after Rome eventually granted three other private rescue ships permission to dock in Italy but refused the Ocean Viking. Premier Giorgia Meloni then praised France for taking the migrants in, although the French government had not said so publicly.\n\nFrench Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said the passengers would ultimately be divided among France and 11 other European Union countries.\n\nAs apparent retaliation for Italy\u2019s behavior, Darmanin announced France\u2019s withdrawal from a \u201csolidarity\u201d mechanism approved in June to reduce the pressure on front-line countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain by taking in asylum-seekers. French officials also announced new border checks with Italy.\n\nWhile politicians battled over the 230 people aboard the Ocean Viking, they are a fraction of those fleeing global crises this year. From January to August this year, France received 82,535 asylum requests, more than any EU country but Germany. Italy came in fifth, with 43,750 asylum applications.\n\nFrance\u2019s reaction appeared to have taken Italy by surprise. Italy\u2019s Meloni on Friday lashed back at what she said was France\u2019s \u201caggressive,\u201d \u201cincomprehensible and unjustified\u201d measures.\n\nThe premier said she had a voter mandate to change the way Europe deals with mass migration and that Italy would no longer accept being the main disembarkation point for asylum-seekers crossing the Mediterranean.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not written in any agreement,\u201d she said, noting that Italy has taken in nearly 90,000 migrants so far this year. The EU redistribution accord called for 8,000 of them to be resettled in 13 member countries; to date 117 have been relocated, 38 of them to France.\n\n\u201cSomething in this mechanism isn\u2019t working,\u201d Meloni said.\n\nAdvocacy groups agree that France has been slow in processing asylum-seekers as part of the sharing agreement.\n\nSOS Mediterranee said Friday it plans to send the Ocean Viking back to sea \u201cdespite the obstacles.\u201d Doctors Without Borders, whose Geo Barents ship was also caught in the recent migration drama, said the same: \u201cThese operations are and will be the response to irresponsible European and national policies of refusing to help those at sea.\u201d\n\nItalian news reports said French President Emmanuel Macron and Meloni had agreed at the U.N. climate summit in Egypt that France would take in the Ocean Viking, but that the Italian government had undermined the verbal accord by prematurely claiming victory in the standoff.\n\nFrance\u2019s actions empowered Meloni\u2019s center-left opponents, who said the outcome isolated Italy from its European partners.\n\n\u201cShows of strength over migrants not only don\u2019t pay off but provoke international isolation and a loss of credibility,\u201d tweeted lawmaker Piero Fassino of the Democratic Party. \u201cGetting into fights with partners like France is wrong, especially when you need allies.\u201d\n\nIn France, far-right politicians unleashed a barrage of criticism against Macron.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right National Rally. \u201cImmigration to France is not an unconditional right.\u201d\n\nThe far-right uproar in both countries over Mediterranean Sea migrants stands in sharp contrast to Europe\u2019s welcome of millions of Ukrainians who fled after the Russian invasion.\n\nCredit : Associated Press (AP) | Photo Credit : (AP)\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

The 40th and 41st ASEAN Summits and Related Summits concluded in Cambodia on Sunday, achieving fruitful results for greater regional cooperation towards the post-COVID-19 pandemic socio-economic recovery.

    text: "A CRAFT FAIR in aid of the Ukrainian troops is set to take place at the Fire Station Creative this weekend.\n\nSvitlana Iniakoviene, who moved from Ukraine to Dunfermline 10 years ago, is running the event to raise enough money to buy an armoured vehicle for her brother and his military regiment.\n\nWhile she didn't have to flee her home while the war broke out, she, like many Ukranian nationals, has been affected greatly.\n\nShe said: \"They were not military men before last February, now they are in the Ukrainian army because there's a war in their homeland. They're defending our freedom, towns, villages and families. Every one of them is someone's son, husband or dad. Everyone is dreaming about a peaceful life after the war but now they are doing their best fighting against their ruthless enemies, protecting all of us.\n\n\"It was a nightmare, my parents live next to Kyiv and I am trying to support them every day, messaging them, calling them and checking they are okay. My brother is on the frontline so it's something very unreal for us, it's terrible, it's like a bad movie.\"\n\nHer brother, Serhii, is currently in a military camp preparing for his next missions. He is the driving force behind all of Svitlana's efforts.\n\nShe continued: \"At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia started bombing central Ukraine so my brother joined the armed forces and participated in all the main battles, liberating Kyiv, Irpin, Bahmut, Solidar and other places.\n\n\"Now, for eight months of the war, he has been through a lot fighting in Eastern Ukraine where he lost a lot of his friends. He learned how to fly drones and gained experience in aerial reconnaissance so he and six of his friends who have been with him since the beginning are drone operators now.\n\n\"They regularly ride to the frontline in close proximity to the enemy. At the moment, they're preparing for very dangerous reconnaissance operations.\n\n\"They remain in place for 40 to 45 minutes, launch the drone and transmit the data to the Ukrainian artillery. Serhii and his team desperately need an armoured vehicle to keep them safe during reconnaissance missions.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time that Svitlana, her family and friends have raised money to get her brother and his fellow soldiers the protective equipment they need, having worked hard to send over helmets, armoured vests, tactical gloves, ballistic glasses and more at the start of the war.\n\nNow, she is holding a craft fair to raise the remaining \u00a35,000 needed to send them the armoured Land Rover.\n\n\"I need to buy the car on November 14, we put a deposit in the car owner's account on October 7 and he gave us limited time so I hope we can buy it and then we'll try to go to Ukraine as fast as possible and bring them this gift from us,\" she added.\n\n\"A donation of any size will mean we can respond faster to the situation, and the faster we respond, the more lives we can save. This support has never been needed more in my home country and me and my family will be always appreciate even the smallest donation because we believe it will make a difference and save lives.\n\nIn total, the car costs \u00a314,500 and with the money they have raised and the \u00a31,500 deposit they paid, they are well on their way to achieving their goal.\n\nFife Provost Jim Leishman has been a great help in organising the event, he reached out to the venue on Svitlana's behalf and sorted out a date and time for the event.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think this is a noble effort by Svitlana and she deserves the support of the good people of Fife. I urge everyone to do their bit and support her craft fair.\u201d\n\nTo help support Svitlana send vital support to her brother on the frontline, head along to the Fire Station Creative on Sunday between 11am to 3pm to enjoy the craft fair, workshops, raffle, photoshoot of Ukranian ethnic dress and a live performance from Ukranian concert cellist Kateryna Tunina.",

In the still-undecided House, Republicans seem likely to eke out only a razor-thin majority.\n\nThe results have emboldened Trump\u2019s Republican detractors and sapped most of his political momentum heading into the Tuesday campaign launch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically the third election in a row that Donald Trump has cost us the race, and it\u2019s like, three strikes and you\u2019re out,\u201d said Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a vocal Trump critic, Sunday on CNN.\n\nTrump\u2019s response has been to double down on unfounded claims of ballot rigging in the midterms, posting on his Truth Social platform that the results were a \u201cscam\u201d \u2014 and pointing a finger of blame at Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Mitch McConnell\u2019s fault,\u201d he posted, saying the Kentuckian had badly allocated campaign funds and pursued a flawed legislative agenda.\n\n\u201cHe blew the Midterms, and everyone despises him,\u201d said Trump, who has long been at loggerheads with McConnell.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement is widely seen as a way to take the wind out of the sails of potential Republican rivals, namely Ron DeSantis, the freshly-reelected Florida governor and rising star who has also won the backing of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s conservative media empire.\n\nThe speech is also set for the day that another possible 2024 rival \u2014 former vice president Mike Pence \u2014 publishes his memoirs recounting the pressure Trump laid on him to overturn the last election.\n\nTrump\u2019s new White House pursuit will be hampered by the multiple investigations into his conduct before, during and after the presidency \u2014 which could result in his disqualification.\n\nThose include allegations of fraud by his family business, his role in last year\u2019s January 6 attack on the US Capitol and his handling of classified documents at his private Florida home, which was raided by the FBI in August.\n\nBut the former president is no stranger to scandal and has even survived two impeachments due to his continued Republican support in Congress.\n\nThe 2024 election could yet prove to be a repeat of 2020, with Biden reaffirming on Wednesday that he intends to stand for reelection.\n\nBut despite the strong midterm results, some in Biden\u2019s own camp would clearly prefer him to sit out, due to his age and unpopularity. Biden, 80, said he will make a final decision next year.",

Sign up for NBC New York newsletters.\n\nMagnus had initially refused to step down from his job after a request by the Biden administration an official from the Department of Homeland Security told NBC News.\n\nMagnus's removal is part of a larger shakeup expected at Homeland Security as it struggles to manage migrants coming from a wider range of countries, including Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua. This comes as Republicans are likely to take control of the House in January and are expected to launch investigations into the border.\n\nMigrants were stopped 2.38 million times at the Mexican border in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, up 37% from the year before. The annual total surpassed 2 million for the first time in August and is more than twice the highest level during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, in 2019.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times was first to report on the ultimatum. In a statement to the newspaper, Magnus said he was asked by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to step down or be fired.\n\nTwo planes of about 50 migrants arrived in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts on Wednesday night from Florida, by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Massachusetts officials say the planes initially came from Texas. DeSantis\u2019 move is just one of many by Republican governors to send migrants elsewhere in the U.S. in what they consider to be a failure of the Biden Administration's border policies.

    text: "Image Civilians and soldiers in the central square of Kherson on Saturday, gathered around a satellite dish set up for people to communicate with loved ones. Credit... Lynsey Addario for The New York Times\n\nKHERSON, Ukraine \u2014 Ukrainian officials were preparing on Sunday to race food, water and medicine to the city of Kherson just two days after its troops re-entered it, while the military worked to secure more of the city and assess the extent of destruction after nearly nine months of occupation.\n\nRussia captured Kherson, a symbolic and strategic prize for President Vladimir V. Putin, at the start of the war, and immediately moved to cut the city off from the world. Ukrainian officials and allies feared that once the city was liberated they would discover the signs of destruction that Russia left behind in other towns and cities.\n\nMore than eight months of war have displaced more than seven million people within Ukraine, leaving some towns and cities with less than half their population. Millions more have fled Ukraine altogether.\n\n\u201cRussian occupying forces and collaborators did everything possible to make those people who remained in the city suffer as hard as possible during these days of waiting, weeks of waiting, months,\u201d Roman Golovnya, an adviser to the mayor of Kherson, said on national television.\n\nThe threat from Russian forces remained, officials warned on Sunday. Yaroslav Yanushevych, the head of the regional military administration, on Sunday urged residents of the city and surrounding region to evacuate, citing the risk of Russian attacks.\n\nBut on Sunday, though villages outside it have been heavily hit, there were signs that Kherson had not suffered the extent of devastation faced by cities like Mariupol, which Russian forces leveled. While more than three-quarters of Kherson\u2019s residents have fled since the war, leaving about 75,000 people, and there was limited water supply, many buildings and streets appeared intact.\n\nThe Ukrainian strategy of patiently attacking Russian forces over months, launching pinpoint strikes on their supply lines and positions, seemed to have preserved at least the fabric of the city.\n\nResidents of Kherson told stories for the first time of enduring months of explosions and shelling, describing the extreme precision with which Ukraine used HIMARS, an advanced missile system, against Russian positions and supply lines. One woman said she remembered surviving a blast 100 yards from her.\n\nUkrainians targeted Russian positions in the city with the aid of a network of informants, working to avoid hitting civilians. One Russian stronghold near a hospital was leveled by Ukrainian shelling. But the blast appeared to leave the facility relatively unscathed, with its windows intact. Along Ushakova Avenue, an elegant boulevard through the city lined with trees, most of the buildings were undamaged.\n\nThe Russian repression often happened in the shadows, with residents speaking of friends and family who were detained and disappeared over nine months of Russian occupation. Ukrainian officials will surely focus on uncovering such reports, as they did in Bucha, the town near the capital where hundreds of bodies were discovered after barely a month of Russian occupation.\n\nIn Kherson, after a day of celebration on Friday, the streets were quiet. In one high-rise district, there was a lone light in a window from a kerosene lamp or a candle. With no power, there was no heat or running water. As Russia has lost territory in the war in the past two months, it has turned to indiscriminate attacks on civilians and targeting power infrastructure, leaving cities, including Kyiv, the capital, with blackouts.\n\nResidents of Kherson filled jugs of water to carry up darkened stairwells. But, for now, neighbors were sharing what they had and Ukrainian officials said convoys of aid were being readied to be raced into the city once the roads were considered to be safe from Russian mines.\n\n\u201cAnd now the city is critically lacking first of all water, because there is practically no water supply in the city,\u201d Mr. Golovnya said. \u201cNow there is not enough medicine, there is not enough bread \u2014 it is not baked, because there is no electricity.\u201d",

    title: "UK PM In New Controversy Over Cabinet Picks",
    text: "London: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faced new questions on Saturday over his choice of senior officials after his number two was accused of behaving aggressively towards staff.\n\nThe controversy over Dominic Raab, who is deputy prime minister and justice secretary, came after fellow Sunak ally Gavin Williamson was forced out of the new government because of alleged bullying.\n\nRaab, Sunak's most vocal supporter in the summer Conservative leadership race against Liz Truss, was brought back into the cabinet when Truss was forced out as prime minister after just six weeks.\n\nSunak restored him to his previous role of justice secretary, where he had presided over a 'culture of fear', according to the Guardian newspaper.\n\nSome 15 senior civil servants at the ministry were offered a 'route out' to different government jobs if they felt unable to serve under Raab because of his past behaviour, it said.\n\nThe Sun newspaper meanwhile reported that Raab had once hurled tomatoes from a salad across a room in a fit of anger during a meeting -- which a spokesman for the minister said was 'nonsense'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore generally, the spokesman said: 'Dominic has high standards, works hard, and expects a lot from his team as well as himself.\n\n'He has worked well with officials to drive the government's agenda across Whitehall in multiple government departments and always acts with the utmost professionalism.'\n\nSunak was already under fire for reappointing Williamson to a ministerial role despite being told he was under investigation for allegedly bullying another senior Conservative.\n\nThe prime minister also faced criticism for reinstating Suella Braverman as interior minister just six days after she was forced to quit the Truss cabinet over a security breach.\n\nThe opposition Labour party pointed to those controversies as it termed the latest accusations 'deeply troubling', demanding Sunak launch an inquiry.\n\n'With each new scandal and grubby deal, it becomes more obvious that he is a weak leader who puts party management before the national interest,' Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Sunak, who is preparing next week to unveil an emergency economic package after a tax-slashing budget by Truss sparked a financial crisis.",

      "Uptick in Pet Turtle Demand Drives Poaching, Risks 50% of Remaining Species into Possible Extinction",
    text: "Growing demand for pet turtles is steadily fueling an uptick in poaching. According to experts, this may result in the extinction of 50% of the remaining species.\n\nThe illegal sale of reptiles online is a growing concern, according to Lou Perrotti, director of conservation programs at Providence's Roger Williams Park Zoo.\n\nIn a recent wildlife raid, 16 turtle hatchlings the size of quarters were seized. These eastern musk turtles are infamous for spending a large portion of their lives in ponds and swamps and for producing an offensive odor when threatened.\n\nConfiscated and Quarantined Tiny Musk Turtles\n\nThe little musk turtles were discovered being sold online by an intern with the Rhode Island Environmental Police. Each one costs only $20 according to its internet listing. The five-inch (13-centimeter) long, brown or black turtles have a yellow or white line running along the top of their heads and can live for decades.\n\nIn September, after planning an undercover purchase at the seller's home, police arrested him. For illegally owning a reptile, the seller was fined $1,600. The turtles are currently housed in two plastic bins and are being kept in a clean, well-lit quarantine area at a zoo in Rhode Island in the hopes that they will soon be healthy enough to be released back into the wild.\n\nPoaching Towards Extinction\n\nPerotti claimed that there has been an increase in turtle poaching, which is becoming more ruthless and is causing thousands of turtles to leave the United States every year. He continued by saying that turtle populations couldn't withstand such a blow from such a high rate of removal from the wild.\n\nWildlife trade specialists think that poaching, which is being fueled by a rise in pet demand in the US, Asia, and Europe, is a factor in the global extinction of rare freshwater turtle as well as tortoise species. Over half of the 360 species of living turtles and tortoises, according to a study published in Current Biology, are in danger of going extinct.\n\nTwelve proposals to strengthen freshwater turtle protection have been made in response to these worries at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) meeting being held in Panama from November 14 through November 25 where 184 nations are scheduled to attend.\n\nHopes for Banning, Restriction of Commercial Trade\n\nIt can be challenging to locate precise statistics on the turtle trade, especially the illegal trade. According to Tara Easter, a doctoral candidate at the University of Michigan who studies the trade, the number of mud turtles exported commercially from the United States rose from 1,844 in 1999 to almost 40,000 in 2017 as well as from 8,254 in 1999 to over 281,000 in 2016.\n\nThe United States along with several Latin American countries referred to data from Mexico that showed that almost 20,000 turtles were confiscated, most from the Mexico City airport, from 2010 to 2022 in their CITES call to ban or restrict the commercial trade in over 20 mud turtle species.\n\nFreshwater turtles are among the most trafficked animals in the world, and criminal groups that target them send the reptiles to black markets throughout Hong Kong as well as other Asian cities after connecting with buyers online. They are then sold as pets, to collectors, for commercial breeding, food, and traditional medicine, as well as for use in traditional medicine. Trade is either insufficiently or completely unregulated in many nations.\n\nRead also: Janus the Two-Headed Tortoise Approaches 25th Birthday on Saturday\n\nPoachers, Climate Change, Predators\n\nThe lucrative industry adds to the dangers that turtles already face because some species are sought after for their unique or colorful shells, which can fetch thousands of dollars in Asia. These include habitat loss, road fatalities, and predators consuming their eggs.\n\nBecause they target endangered species as well as adult breeding females, poachers are a particular problem, according to experts. Many turtle species, which have a lifespan of several decades, take ten years or longer to reach reproductive maturity.\n\nAccording to Dave Collins, the Turtle Survival Alliance's director of North American turtle conservation initiatives, the loss of significant numbers of adults, particularly females, can plunge turtle populations into a downward spiral from which they are unable to recover. The reproduction rate of turtles is incredibly low; they lay only a few eggs per year, AP News reports.\n\nResponsible Private Ownership\n\nLimiting captive breeding and legal trade to address declines in wild populations is counterproductive, according to the United States Association of Reptile Keepers, which promotes responsible private ownership as well as trade in reptiles and amphibians.\n\nNative species removal, even to keep pets, has a significant impact, according to Harold Guise, a police detective specializing in environmental cases. Guise, who handled the case, added that We cannot even begin to measure the effects of the commercialization of wildlife until it has already taken place.\n\nIt served as a reminder to Perrotti, that the once-concentrated illegal trade in Asia is now increasingly occurring in his backyard.\n\nPerrotti expressed his skepticism regarding the existence of a market for it and the idea that people were either mass producing or mass gathering these reptiles to profit financially. He continued by saying that the idea of a $20 turtle is absurd because wildlife is not a commodity that can be sold for a profit, The Telegraph reports.\n\nRelated article: Zoo Finally Welcomes 41 Hatchlings After Two Decades of Waiting for Endangered Rare Turtles to Breed -San Diego",

So, if you ever get in that situation, and you\u2019ve got kids in your car, I think you can stay out of it as you can because you never know the retaliation of the person that has the road rage.\u201d\n\nThe Washington State Patrol says this latest incident of road rage happened at about 2:35 p.m. Friday.\n\nIsaiah was a passenger in a Dodge Durango on SR 167 when a driver in another vehicle opened fire, hitting him in the mouth and chest.\n\nThe suspect fled in this dark blue Ford Mustang convertible on Southwest Grady Way toward SE Carr Road and disappeared.\n\n\u201cSometimes I worry about it,\u201d said Fahmi Guled of Seattle.\n\nIt isn\u2019t lost on drivers like Guled, that they, too, could be a victim of road rage.\n\n\u201c\u2018Cause obviously you don\u2019t know what kind of day someone is having,\u201d Guled said. \u201cAnd if you cut \u2018em off, you know, it could just be the tipping point.\u201d\n\nJoseph was asked what he thinks drivers should do.\n\n\u201cTell \u2018em sorry, a few times,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone gives you the finger, I don\u2019t think that you should engage and give them the finger back. Probably best to let them go ahead of you, maybe pull off to the side and go another route.\u201d\n\nThe Washington State Patrol says the driver of the vehicle that Isaiah was in tried to do just that.\n\nIf you have any information about the driver, you\u2019re asked to call 911.\n\nThe good news is, Isaiah is getting better. Still, his mother says he has a long road ahead.\n\nThe family has set up a GoFundMe account for those who would like to donate and help Isaiah on his road of recovery.\n\nFollow this link to read additional stories from KIRO 7\n\n\u00a92022 Cox Media Group",

    text: "Prime Minister Yair Lapid is expected to soon become opposition leader, since he heads the largest party that is not planning to enter incoming premier Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. But though his Yesh Atid party has been acting as if it leads an alliance, its erstwhile allies from the outgoing government are peeling away from the notion of a unified opposition.\n\nInfighting over how to manage the so-called \u201cchange bloc\u201d started during the campaign season, but exploded into full-out blame-casting after the election delivered a crushing blow to two former Knesset parties, the left-wing Meretz and Palestinian nationalist Balad. Although Balad did not align itself with either Lapid\u2019s or Netanyahu\u2019s bloc, it played a strategic role in bloc-building math.\n\nBoth Meretz and Balad narrowly failed to clear the 3.25 percent of the vote threshold to enter Knesset, burning 288,789 votes and solidifying the Likud-bloc victory. Labor leader Merav Michaeli \u2013 who adamantly refused Lapid\u2019s urging that she run a joint slate with Meretz \u2013 heaped blame on Lapid, alleging he mismanaged the bloc. Her criticism extended to Lapid failing to keep Balad as part of the Joint List and not strong-arming all parties outside Netanyahu\u2019s Likud-led bloc to make surplus-vote agreements.\n\nPoliticians from Benny Gantz\u2019s National Unity party also attacked Lapid for bloc mismanagement, with an anonymous senior source calling Lapid\u2019s campaign strategy \u201ca resounding failure\u201d that failed to play the critical ground game.\n\nMansour Abbas, leader of the Islamist Ra\u2019am party, said shortly before the election that he was aligned with Lapid\u2019s bloc and on Sunday it joined a meeting of parties heading into the opposition with Yesh Atid faction chair MK Boaz Toporovsky. But later in the day, Ra\u2019am MK Walid Taha made it clear \u201cthat Ra\u2019am has never been part of a bloc, and it will consolidate its positions and decide about its next steps.\u201d\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms\n\nMeanwhile, the National Unity party, led by outgoing defense minister Gantz, said shortly after the election that it will continue to build itself \u201cas a governing alternative,\u201d indicating that it was not lining up behind Lapid. During the campaign, Gantz campaigned as a candidate for prime minister, undercutting Lapid\u2019s leadership of the bloc.\n\nNeither National Unity, nor Ra\u2019am, nor right-wing Yisrael Beytenu, nor non-aligned majority-Arab party Hadash-Ta\u2019al recommended Lapid to form the next government during their meetings with President Isaac Herzog last week, opting instead to make no recommendation.\n\nIn the end, only Yesh Atid and the much-weakened Labor party \u2013 now the Knesset\u2019s smallest with only four seats \u2013 put Lapid forward for the premiership, a symbolic gesture that nonetheless speaks volumes about who Yesh Atid has in its corner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe disunity should not come as a total surprise for an eclectic smorgasbord of parties that came together in June 2021 against all odds given the ideological gulfs between them. Then, as now, their strongest unifier was the desire to keep Netanyahu out of power.\n\nThe outgoing opposition, on the other hand, was united by common threads of right-wing ideology and, among Likud and the Haredi parties, longstanding political partnerships. The bloc was disciplined about taking down the change government, decrying it as illegitimate from the start and calling its first prime minister, Naftali Bennett, a \u201cscoundrel\u201d as he ascended to the Knesset floor.\n\nThe singular focus on toppling the coalition \u2014 a risky strategy that saw the Likud-led bloc torpedo legislation it and its voters ideologically supported \u2014 ended up paying political dividends.\n\nLapid has signaled that the opposition under his leadership will take the high road, opposing the government, but not the state. Leaders from Yesh Atid and National Unity explain this to mean that they will support legislation they deem \u201cgood,\u201d and oppose measures evaluated as \u201cbad.\u201d\n\nBut just because Yesh Atid deems a bill \u201cbad\u201d does not mean Yisrael Beytenu or any other opposition party will. What discipline there will be among the incoming opposition will come mostly as a product of their shared refusal to provide broad support for Netanyahu\u2019s coalition.\n\nAt the same time, there is a deeper ideological thread that unites the parties moving into the opposition: their professed commitment to liberal democratic values. While opposition parties may disagree about Palestinian statehood, for example, they are unlikely to find much to argue about among themselves when it comes to opposing the panoply of far-reaching reforms and policy rollbacks being readied by Likud-bloc parties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Zionist parties of the incoming opposition have been united in attacking Netanyahu-ally proposals that would put a political thumb over the courts, constrain eligibility for Jewish emigration to Israel under the Law of Return, extend sovereignty over the West Bank without granting Palestinians citizenship, reverse religious liberalizations, deport \u201cdisloyal\u201d citizens, and ban gay pride parades, among others.\n\nBy pushing for extreme proposals that almost nobody in the opposition could fathom supporting, the incoming coalition is seemingly making it easier for its opponents to find common cause to rally around.\n\nAlthough there is much ideological diversity within its right-religious side of the spectrum, the Likud-led bloc is aligned on being a \u201cfully right-wing government\u201d whose central struggle may be restraining its members\u2019 most drastic impulses, rather than squabbling over the rough bounds of what it means for Israel to be both Jewish and democratic.\n\nShould the Netanyahu-led government succeed in delivering the political stability it promises, the new opposition will have time to finally stop its infighting, perhaps align on core principles, and maybe even find its own power.",

Picture: NCA NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nThe looming shortage comes as the report found the number of cyber attacks in Australia is expected to double over the next five years.\n\nAustralians are already under threat from cyber attacks, experiencing such an event every one to two minutes, with 745 reported per day in 2021.\n\nThe average cyber security worker in Australia earns $120,000 per year, with entry-level salaries starting at $100,000.\n\nThe report names a lack of funding as a reason behind the emerging shortage, with Australian cyber security start-ups receiving 300 times\u2019 less funding than international peer leaders.\n\nMillions of Australians have already had their data accessed in historic cyber attacks on Optus and Medibank.\n\nThe identification details of 9.8 million customers of telecommunications operator Optus were stolen in one of the largest data breaches to occur in Australia. Picture: Brendon Thorne / Getty Images\n\nThe data of almost 10 million Optus customers was accessed by hackers in September, with thousands having passport, drivers licences and Medicare numbers stolen in the attack.\n\nMore than 9.7 million Australians had their personal data stolen just last month, with the credentials of a high-level Medibank employee obtained and sold to hackers via a cybercriminal forum.\n\nRussian hackers carried out a cyberattack on Medibank which breached the data of 9.7 million people, including Australia\u2019s Prime Minister, police said. Picture: Muhammad Farooq / AFP\n\nThe Medibank hackers have begun releasing records of those caught up in the attack, including medical records related to substance abuse and pregnancy termination.\n\nCyber crime is one of the fastest-growing types of criminal activity faced by Australians, according to Professor Nicholas Biddle, co-author of a survey by the Australian National University into the prevalence of hacks.\n\n\u201cRoughly one third of adult Australians, or around 6.4 million people, have been the victim of a breach in the last 12 months,\u201d said Professor Biddle, from the ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods.\n\nOriginally published as Huge cyber security skills shortage amid six-figure salaries on offer",

      "Biden, Xi stress need to work together as they meet for talks ahead of G20",
    text: "NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) -Chinese leader Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden met on Monday for long-awaited talks that come as relations between their countries are at their lowest in decades, marred by disagreements over a host of issues from Taiwan to trade.\n\nThe two, holding their first in-person talks since Biden became president, met on the Indonesian island of Bali ahead of a Group of 20 (G20) summit on Tuesday that is set to be fraught with tension over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThey smiled as they shook hands warmly in front of a row of Chinese and U.S. flags in a ballroom at the luxury hotel Mulia on Bali\u2019s Nusa Dua bay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just great to see you,\u201d Biden told Xi as he put an arm around him, adding in remarks delivered in front of reporters that he was committed to keeping lines of communication open on a personal and government level.\n\n\u201cAs the leaders of our two nations, we share responsibility, in my view, to show that China and the United States can manage our differences, prevent competition from \u2026 turning into conflict, and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned climate change and food insecurity as problems the world expected their two countries to address.\n\nResponding to Biden, Xi said the relationship between their two countries was not meeting global expectations.\n\n\u201cSo we need to chart the right course for the China-U.S. relationship. We need to find the right direction for the bilateral relationship going forward and elevate the relationship,\u201d Xi said.\n\n\u201cThe world expects that China and the United States will properly handle the relationship,\u201d he said, adding he looked forward to working with Biden to bring the relationship back on the right track.\n\nNeither leader wore a mask to ward off COVID though members of their delegations did.\n\nTheir main topics of discussion are expected to be Taiwan, Ukraine and North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions, issues that will also loom over the G20 that is being held without Russian President Vladimir Putin in attendance.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will represent Putin at the G20 summit \u2013 the first since Russia invaded Ukraine in February \u2013 after the Kremlin said Putin was too busy to attend. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said a report that Lavrov was taken to hospital after arriving in Bali was fake news.\n\nOn Sunday, Biden told Asian leaders in Cambodia that U.S. communication lines with China would stay open to prevent conflict, with tough talks almost certain in the days ahead.\n\nRelations have been roiled in recent years by growing tensions over issues ranging from Hong Kong and Taiwan to the South China Sea, trade practices and U.S. restrictions on Chinese technology.\n\nBut U.S. officials said there have been quiet efforts by both Beijing and Washington over the past two months to repair ties.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters in Bali earlier that the meeting was \u201cintended to stabilize the relationship between the United States and China, and to create a more certain atmosphere for U.S. businesses\u201d.\n\nShe said that Biden had been clear with China about national security concerns regarding restrictions on sensitive U.S. technologies and had raised concern about the reliability of Chine supply chains for commodities like minerals.\n\nNUCLEAR \u2018IRRESPONSIBILITY\u2019\n\nBiden and Xi, who have held five phone or video calls since Biden became president in January 2021, last met in person during the Obama administration when Biden was vice president.\n\nMonday\u2019s meeting was unlikely to produce a joint statement, the White House has said.\n\nG20 summit host President Joko Widodo of Indonesia said he hoped the gathering on Tuesday could \u201cdeliver concrete partnerships that can help the world in its economic recovery\u201d.\n\nHowever, one of the main topics at the G20 will be Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and Biden will be \u201cunapologetic\u201d in his defense of the European nation, U.S. officials said last week.\n\nXi and Putin have grown increasingly close in recent years, bound by their shared distrust of the West, and reaffirmed their partnership just days before Russia invaded Ukraine. But China has been careful not to provide any direct material support that could trigger Western sanctions against it.\n\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang emphasized the \u201cirresponsibility\u201d of nuclear threats during the summit in Cambodia, suggesting China was uncomfortable with strategic partner Russia\u2019s nuclear rhetoric, the Biden administration official said.\n\nThe West has accused Russia of making irresponsible statements on the possible use of nuclear weapons since its February invasion of Ukraine. Russia has in turn accused the West of \u201cprovocative\u201d nuclear rhetoric.\n\nRussia\u2019s Lavrov said on Sunday the West was \u201cmilitarizing\u201d Southeast Asia in a bid to contain Russian and Chinese interests.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he would address the G20 by video link on Tuesday.\n\n(Reporting by Nandita Bose, Fransiska Nangoy, Leika Kihara, David Lawder and Simon Lewis in Nusa Dua, Tian Lun Ye and Ryan Woo in Beijing ; Writing by Kay Johnson and Raju Gopalakrishnan; Editing by Robert Birsel and Tom Hogue)",

    text: "This block of ice in Antarctica, which is visible on Google Earth, is claimed by some as evidence of alien life.\n\nA popular YouTube channel that peddles conspiracy theories is trying to convince viewers that photos of an avalanche on an island near Antarctica depict an alien spaceship crash site.\n\nIn a video posted to the channel SecureTeam10, a narrator claims that an image of South Georgia Island taken from Google Earth shows the remains of an extraterrestrial craft that slammed into the side of a mountain and skidded a long distance across the ice.\n\nThe photo does show a lot of disturbed ice on the side of a glacier near Mount Paget, a 9,629-foot-tall (2,935 meters) prominence on the British-controlled island far to the south of Argentina. A long trail extends away from the main disturbed area, leading to a white object that appears embedded in the snow on top of the glacier. [25 Strangest Sights on Google Earth]\n\nRichard Waller, a senior lecturer in physical geography at Keele University in the United Kingdom, told The Daily Mail that the photo actually depicts an avalanche that cast one large block of ice skidding and rolling much farther than the rest of the collapsed snow, and that the white object is that block of ice. This scenario is also, frankly, pretty obvious to even a casual observer.\n\nIn a zoomed-out image, it's pretty obvious what's going on here. (Image credit: DigitalGlobe/Google)\n\nSecureTeam10's video on the subject has nonetheless been viewed nearly half a million times as of this writing. The channel's conspiratorial videos routinely garner hundreds of thousands of views.\n\nIn addition, the channel bears a \"verification\" check mark from YouTube. Google, on an oblique web page explaining the YouTube verification process (Google owns and operates YouTube), writes that a check mark indicates \"that the channel belongs to an established creator or is the official channel of a brand, business or organization.\"\n\nIt's not clear precisely what criteria earned SecureTeam10 its YouTube verification. Live Science wrote to Google, requesting clarification on why SecureTeam10 was given such a check mark, but we did not receive a reply by the time this article was published.\n\nOriginally published on Live Science.",

Quite the opposite.

Possibly.\n\nLast Thursday, Oak Bay police answered a call about an intruder in a home on Beach Drive. Officers arrived at 4 a.m. to find the feathered suspect perched on a couch staring right back at them.\n\nAfter some coaxing, the intruder casually walked outside through open patio doors and flew away.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the end of it.\n\nOn Sunday, a house on nearby Musgrave Street got a visit from what is thought to be the same barred owl.\n\nTina Gaboury went to check her friend\u2019s home and found the whole place in disarray \u2014 pictures down, things tipped over and droppings everywhere.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I thought was we got robbed,\u201d said Gaboury.\n\nBut to her surprise, she saw an owl perched on a chandelier, calmly staring her down.\n\nGaboury called her brother-in-law, Dan Lauchlan, who is \u201cgood with animals.\u201d Lauchlan was able to put a towel over the owl and gently carry it outside to a table.\n\nHe removed the covering and the owl just stayed, said Gaboury, allowing them both to gently pet and admire the raptor.\n\n\u201cHe stayed there for a long time and was really calm,\u201d said Gaboury. \u201cThen he just flew away. It was really amazing because I\u2019ve never seen an owl that close before.\u201d\n\nHow the owl got into the house was a bit of a mystery, because the doors and windows were locked.\n\nBut based on soot marks on the ceiling and walls, Gaboury believes the owl entered through the chimney and fireplace.\n\nShe thinks it\u2019s the same owl that was lounging in the Beach Drive home.\n\nKnown to live in both forest and urban areas, barred owls are among the most common owls on the south coast of B.C. An Environment Canada fact sheet says barred owls are not typically shy around humans.\n\ndkloster@timescolonist.com",

But I\'ve been very clear that we\'re going to continue to provide the capability for the Ukrainian people to defend themselves."\n\nZelenskyy has previously appeared unexpectedly in other front-line zones at crucial junctures of the war, to support troops and congratulate them for battlefield exploits.\n\nLarge parts of eastern and southern Ukraine are still under Russian control, and the city of Kherson itself remains within reach of Moscow\'s shells and missiles. Heavy fighting continued elsewhere in the country.\n\nIn Kherson, Zelenskyy distributed medals to soldiers Ukrainian troops in a central square and posed for selfies with them.\n\nVideo footage also showed him waving to residents who waved at him from an apartment window and yelled "Glory to Ukraine!"

Russia still controls about 70 per cent of the wider Kherson region.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine has won "an important victory" in recapturing the city and other areas west of the Dnipro River, but the Washington-based think tank noted that "it has by no means liberated the minimum territory essential to its future security and economic survival".\n\nIn this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office and posted on Facebook, local residents greet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his visit to Kherson.

      "How can analytics education help prepare India\u2019s next-generation decision science experts?",
    text: "Earlier, organizations from different sectors used to drive decisions through legacy systems which used to process mostly organization-specific data recorded as a result of the organization\u2019s activities. Hence, the skill set to run such practices was limited to using specific underlying technology. During this period, large technology organizations used to promote training programs specific to their proprietary technology. With the advent of the Web 2.0 era, the scope of decision-making wasn\u2019t limited to organization data alone. It was rather about harnessing the power of data from social media platforms, which was abundant because of continued indulgences and interactions of different individuals. There were rich possibilities for analyzing the data in various disciplines. Web 2.0 also brought out some fantastic philosophies like \u201ccrowd-sourcing,\u201d \u201copen-sourcing,\u201d and \u201ccustomerization,\u201d which opened technology doors to every individual. On the analysis front, conceptual knowledge from various computing disciplines like statistics, operations research, structured query language, data mining, data structures, and algorithms surfaced and was used frequently to seek insights and foresight. The Mysterious blend of analysis and technology formulated analytics education\u2019s backbone.\n\nMany universities and institutions have started providing analytics education in the past decade. While analytics education primarily catered to Technical and Analytical skills, which surfaced very early, the education remained incomplete without the knowledge of the field where these need to be applied. Further, since the result of the application was to get insights and foresight to solve the business problem, communicating these ideas and translating them to necessary strategy and actions was also equally important. With these ideas, the formal analytics body of knowledge would contain the following\n\nStatistics Operations Research Data management and Datamining Data Visualization and Storytelling Structured Query Language and Database management Programming Languages for Analytics Business Intelligence and Analytics\n\nFurther, courses on Strategy Simulations in a specific domain will also aid in synthesizing insights and foresight. These courses form the base knowledge or essential competencies of analytics which every future decision expert should be well-versed even if they are not experts in all of them.\n\nThe body of knowledge is further amplified by promising developments in artificial intelligence (AI)and machine learning(ML). While most AI and ML applications are still in nascency, future decision experts will benefit immensely from applications like image analytics and natural language processing.\n\nWhile the body of knowledge seems to be very exhaustive and would be helping future decision science experts, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The forthcoming decision science experts must indulge in these courses by taking up projects and internships. They should participate in competitions to learn from their peers and experience. In this regard, universities and institutions should look at every opportunity to interact and collaborate with corporate organizations. The best possible collaboration will be in the form of customized training programs or getting into data consultancy contracts. These initiatives can help aspiring analytics professionals seamlessly transition into any organization.\n\nThere are enough good reasons why future decision experts should have formal analytics education. One strong reason is that having formal analytics education shall help the decision expert look at the business problem in a perspective backed by logic and not just gut feeling. The other reason is that analytics education will bring down the mental stigma due to the limited range of traditional thinking. Analytics education provides a wide range of solutions for business problems. Essentially formal analytics education will make the dreaded path of decision-making less uncomfortable as well as exciting, given that the aspiring decision expert takes a confident plunge.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Email Disclaimer Views expressed above are the author's own.",

    text: 'By Stanley Widianto\n\nNUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) -Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday dismissed a news agency report that he had been taken to hospital with a heart condition, scolding Western journalists for what he cast as false reporting.\n\nAssociated Press, citing Indonesian officials, said Lavrov had been taken to hospital after arriving on the island of Bali for a Group of 20 summit. AP said Lavrov, 72, had been treated for a heart condition.\n\n"This, of course, is the height of fakery," Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.\n\nZakharova posted a video of Lavrov, President Vladimir Putin\'s foreign minister since 2004, sitting outdoors on a patio, dressed in shorts and a T-shirt and reading documents.\n\nAsked about the report, Lavrov said Western journalists had been writing falsely for a decade that Putin, 70, was ill.\n\n"This is a kind of game that is not new in politics," Lavrov said with an ironic smile. "Western journalists need to be more truthful - they need to write the truth."\n\nLavrov, who arrived in Bali on Sunday evening, said Western media routinely took a partial view of events and ignored Russia\'s point of view.\n\nBali Governor I Wayan Koster told Reuters that Lavrov had briefly visited Sanglah Hospital in Bali for a "check-up" but that the minister was in good health.\n\n"He was in good health and after the check-up he immediately left," the governor said.\n\nAssociated Press said it stood by its story.\n\n"To be clear, AP never reported Lavrov was \'hospitalized\'," said Lauren Easton, AP vice president of Corporate Communications.\n\n"We reported he had been taken to the hospital, and enumerated the number of sources providing that information."\n\nSEASONED DIPLOMAT\n\nLavrov is Russia\'s longest-serving foreign minister since Soviet times, when Andrei Gromyko, nicknamed "Mr Nyet" in the West for his uncompromising approach, held the post for 28 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nA graduate of the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Lavrov speaks fluent English and French and also Sinhalese, having worked as a Soviet diplomat in Sri Lanka.\n\nBefore becoming foreign minister, Lavrov served as Russia\'s permanent representative to the United Nations.\n\nSometimes nicknamed "Dr No" in the West, he is known for his acerbic remarks, especially about interlocutors whom he considers poorly prepared.\n\nBefore Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, Lavrov repeatedly dismissed U.S. and British assertions that Putin was preparing to order an invasion.\n\nAfter the West imposed the most stringent sanctions in modern history on Russia, Lavrov said Moscow would turn away from the United States and its allies and instead expand relations with countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters; editing by Guy Faulconbridge, Kevin Liffey and Gareth Jones)',

      "More repaving, fewer patches: San Diego cracks down on road trenching to boost street quality and safety",
    text: "Aiming to boost the quality of San Diego\u2019s crumbling streets, city officials are planning a crackdown on damage caused by increasingly frequent road trenching to lay cable, fix streetlights, repair pipes and do other work.\n\nChanges proposed to the city\u2019s street preservation law would sharply raise damage fees charged to companies who dig trenches in city streets. The goal is boosting the city\u2019s cost recovery for trench repair from 50 percent to 100 percent.\n\n\u201cThe discount that\u2019s been provided means city taxpayers have to make up the difference,\u201d said Mayor Todd Gloria, who is spearheading the proposed policy change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepairs would also have to be completed more quickly and companies would more often be required to do comprehensive asphalt overlays, instead of the less aggressive slurry seal fixes now typically required after trenching.\n\nMinor upgrades to a street with slurry seal cost about $130,000 per mile, whereas a more fundamental asphalt overlay \u2014 which lasts longer and looks better \u2014 costs about $780,000 per mile.\n\nCompanies would also need to address broader areas of pavement than under current city policy. That\u2019s partly because studies show that even narrow trenches weaken wide areas of a street, making it vulnerable to potholes and premature decay.\n\nThe goals of the new policy are boosting safety, quality of life and neighborhood pride across San Diego, said Gloria, whose staff will present the proposed changes to the City Council\u2019s infrastructure committee Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to improve what San Diegans see every day right in front of their face, which includes streets,\u201d Gloria said.\n\nThe new policy is also expected to reduce the millions San Diego spends annually to cover injury settlements from crashes caused by trenching and related road damage.\n\n\u201cThis will mean more money for roads and less money for legal payouts,\u201d Gloria said.\n\nThe proposed changes come as a consultant nears completion of a $700,000 survey to determine the condition and quality of all 3,000 miles of roads in the city. The survey\u2019s goal is gearing repairs and upgrades to long-neglected roads.\n\nThe crackdown on trenching has been endorsed by the city\u2019s Mobility Board, which advocates for safer routes for bicyclists and pedestrians.\n\nAndy Hanshaw, chairman of the board, said Monday that the board appreciates that the city is making it a priority to address the dangers for bicyclists created by trenching.\n\nThe proposed changes would also raise standards for temporary patches on pavement required for overnight road safety during long-term trenching projects.\n\nIn addition, companies would be required to fix more expensive concrete streets with entire concrete panels. Under the current policy, they have been allowed to repair concrete streets with asphalt.\n\nThe changes would also extend the city\u2019s street preservation law to alleys, which haven\u2019t previously been covered.\n\nStreet damage fees, which vary by the length of a trench and how recently the street was comprehensively overlaid, are typically in the low thousands per trench.\n\nRecent analysis shows the fee has been generating only about half the cost to repair city streets damaged by trenching, forcing taxpayers to cover the other half.\n\nWhen the City Council adopted the street preservation law in 2013, a compromise with industries that conduct frequent trenching called for incrementally increasing damage fees to reach 100 percent cost recovery eventually.\n\nBut city engineering officials never followed through on raising the fees, which have remained the same since 2013. And some policies in the ordinance were never enforced, or were enforced more leniently than the rules called for, city officials said.\n\n\u201cWe passed a law nearly 10 years ago that didn\u2019t fully address the problem,\u201d Gloria said.\n\nOfficials said they\u2019ve held several recent meetings with industry leaders to explain the proposed changes. But officials say they still expect some pushback at Wednesday\u2019s committee meeting.\n\nIn addition to the proposal for sharply higher street damage fees, industry officials object to a policy that would encourage companies to do more joint trenching.\n\nJoint trenching allows multiple projects to be completed with only one trench damaging a street. But industry officials, primarily for competitive reasons, don\u2019t like to let others know when they will be trenching or why.",

    text: "NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun expects employees to spend 25% to 35% less time in the office, keeping downward pressure on office rent. The multifamily sector also saw prices drop with high borrowing rates.\n\nNew markets require new approaches and tactics. Experts and industry leaders take the stage at Inman Connect New York in January to help navigate the market shift \u2014 and prepare for the next one. Meet the moment and join us. Register here.\n\nEven if the job market stays strong, the price of real estate properties like office space and multifamily apartments will drop slightly next year, according to the chief economist of the National Association of Realtors.\n\nLawrence Yun said Saturday that the risk is particularly high for office space while discussing the outlook for commercial real estate at 2022 NAR NXT, the organization\u2019s annual conference, according to an announcement documenting the discussion.\n\nBut high borrowing rates that pushed up cap rates are beginning to take their toll on commercial properties, Yun said.\n\n\u201cNationwide, we are beginning to see some decline in commercial appraisal values,\u201d Yun said. \u201cCap rates simply cannot match up with higher borrowing costs, especially among people who need to refinance their properties.\u201d\n\nWhile the dip for properties, such as multifamily apartments and office space will be slight, Yun said that some markets with strong enough job performance are still keeping prices high.\n\n\u201cStrong job growth is supporting prices in many markets,\u201d Yun said, according to the statement.\n\nThe prediction follows Yun\u2019s forecast that home prices will rise slightly and sales will dip in 2023 before making a strong rebound the following year.\n\nYun predicted that home sales would drop 15 percent in 2022 compared to last year and drop another 7 percent in 2023 before climbing 10 percent in 2024. He also predicted home prices will rise 1 percent next year and 5 percent in 2024.\n\nYun\u2019s forecast for commercial properties didn\u2019t specify how much prices would decline, and it came just before online retail giant Amazon announced it would eliminate 10,000 jobs. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, cut 11,000 people from its staff last week.\n\nReal estate companies, too, have undergone staff cuts in recent months.\n\nAnd regardless of whether the U.S. economy experiences widespread job losses, the market for office space will continue to face downward pressure from the lasting effects of the COVID-19 economy.\n\nYun was joined on stage by Matt Vance, senior director and Americas head of multifamily research for CBRE. Vance said he expects employees will spend 25 percent to 35 percent less time in the office than before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s about a day to a day and a half less in the office,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe believe this will translate to a 15 percent reduction in office space demand per employee.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco may be ground zero for the ongoing effect the pandemic is having on office space. The city\u2019s office vacancy rate has spiked to 25.5 percent, according to CBRE, which the news outlet SFGate reported is an all-time high.\n\nEmail Taylor Anderson\n\nGet Inman\u2019s Property Portfolio Newsletter delivered right to your inbox.

      "Kherson fell quickly, but Ukraine\u2019s progress east of the Dnipro will be harder",
    text: "Ukraine\u2019s swift recapture of Kherson, whose abandonment was only announced publicly by the Russians on Wednesday, sets the stage for a critical phase in the war. An autumn of territorial concessions by Moscow leaves Russia occupying a core block of territory \u2013 the land bridge to Crimea \u2013 that Ukraine will want to split and inflict on the invaders a catastrophic political defeat.\n\nAt first, it will be necessary for Ukraine to consolidate its gains in and around Kherson, restore power and other utilities, although there is no serious land threat, now that the retreating Russian forces have blown up so much of the principal Antonivsky road and rail bridges that led into the city several hundred metres across the Dnipro River, the barrier on which the Russians now hope to rely.\n\nOf greater immediate concern is the blowing up of part of the Nova Kakhovka dam, as revealed by satellite images, which will further disrupt already strained power supplies and whose downstream impact is uncertain. The effect, though, is expected to be felt worst on the Russian-occupied south of the river \u2013 an act that the Geneva conventions warn can be considered a war crime if it leads to \u201cconsequent severe losses among the civilian population\u201d.\n\nAntonivsky and Nova Kakhovka are the only crossings of the Dnipro south of Ukrainian-held Zaporizhzhia city, and without them (or even if they were intact) it will be difficult and dangerous for Ukrainian counterattacks to press ahead there. A glance at the map has led an increasing number of commentators, western and Russian, to suggest an advance in the Zaporizhzhia sector towards Melitopol and Berdyansk is the obvious next point of counterattack.\n\nUkraine\u2019s success in Kherson \u2013 and make no mistake, forcing Russia out with minimal civilian casualties is a major achievement \u2013 was a victory achieved by smashing the Russian supply chain. That was concluded with US Himars artillery, aided almost certainly by good local intelligence to pinpoint command and logistics centres on the ground. But critical also was favourable geography \u2013 the isolated position of Kherson on the west of the Dnipro.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia front to the east is essentially a straight line across open country that has not moved for months, so in theory Moscow\u2019s forces should be well dug in. Russia\u2019s other advantage is that it has called up what it says are 300,000 conscripts, a third of whom are at the front. But manpower alone does not guarantee success \u2013 the new recruits are often placed ahead of more seasoned troops, with reports of newbies being hurled into battle with minimal training, bad equipment \u2013 only two of seven armoured vehicles would start without pushing \u2013 and poor pay.\n\nAt the same time, Russia\u2019s tactical approach has so far been so inflexible that Kyiv will feel confident it can apply the same trick, to hit invaders in the rear so their forward line cannot fight effectively. Now all of Kherson province south of the Dnipro, up to Crimea, is in the 50-mile range of the Himars rockets.\n\nA notable posting last week by a Russian military blogger, Military Informant, conceded that Russia\u2019s position on Kherson had been hopeless since the summer, and that it was only possible to bring forward a tenth of the required supplies. The writer then complained about Russia\u2019s \u201carchaic logistics systems\u201d with long lead times, insufficient high-precision weaponry and, interestingly, \u201ccentralised depots\u201d, which present attractive targets for Ukrainians to disrupt.\n\nAgainst this backdrop it was surprising that last week Gen Mark Milley, the US\u2019s top military officer, talked up \u201cdiplomatic solutions\u201d to the near nine-month war and argued that the Ukrainians had only managed to fight the Russians \u201cto a standstill\u201d. Concerns about a first world war-style deadlock between the two countries do not appear to be matched by the autumn\u2019s developments on the ground in Kherson and, before that, in the liberations near Kharkiv.\n\nMilley\u2019s position appears to be an outlier in the Biden administration, which also announced a further $400m (\u00a3338m) in weapons supplies last week and has been buoyed up by better than expected midterm election results. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, talked up the Kherson victory on Friday and said \u201cIf Ukraine chose to stop fighting and give up, it would be the end of Ukraine\u201d \u2013 and, for now, Kyiv appears to retain US and western support to fight on into next year.\n\nThe winter weather clearly makes the situation more complicated for both sides, although the ground is expected to freeze, increasing the opportunities for manoeuvre, which will help the Ukrainian counterattackers. Last month Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, said he expected fighting to carry on throughout the cold season. Ukraine, with the wind in its sails, will want to show it can press on further, before there is fresh talk of deadlock.",

Indonesia and Thailand had earlier collaborated on a fast response code for cross-border payments. In addition, Singapore and Thailand have also established fast payment interconnection."The digital economy transformation agenda in the financial sector is our shared priority. This is one of the keys to achieve a sustainable economy and is very beneficial for a stronger, more inclusive, and collaborative economy recovery," he noted.Jokowi remarked that Indonesia has accelerated digital financial transformation in the country, with various breakthrough steps, such as developing QRIS, BI-Fast, Smart, and forming a team to accelerate the expansion of regional financial digitization.',

"And I think that the good thing is that more people are waking up to the fact that Arizona has real troubles when it comes to elections."\n\nShe went on to detail in-person delays and voting machines with no toner as evidence of the state\'s difficulty administering an efficient and fair election. On election day, election deniers seized on reports of malfunctioning electronic vote tabulation machines in Arizona as evidence of voter fraud, though there are no indication those temporary voting site issues impacted the election\'s outcome.\n\n"This is a scam and voter fraud, no different than stuffing the ballot boxes," Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday, adding that Lake "was taken to a Liberal Democrat district in order to vote" and the election was "stolen" from Blake Masters, a GOP candidate for Senate who lost his race against Democratic incumbent Mark Kelly. Masters similarly joined in expressing doubt over the election results, saying Maricopa county had "mixed up" ballots and calling for a recount, The Washington Post reported.\n\n"We need to get in there and restore faith in our elections," Lake said."We can\'t be the laughingstock of elections anymore here in Arizona and when I\'m governor I will not allow it. I just won\'t."\n\nRepublicans have won the last four Arizona Governor\'s races with between 52% and 56% of the vote. Though similar claims of voter fraud were levied against the state in the last election cycle, a Republican-led analysis of the 2020 race found elections in the state are conducted securely and had no widespread evidence of fraud, The Washington Post reported.\n\nNearly 90% of the total votes have been tallied in Arizona for this year\'s race, with final results expected on Monday. Hobbs currently leads Lake with 50.8% of the vote for the Governor\'s seat.\n\nRepresentatives for Lake did not immediately respond to Insider\'s requests for comment.',

    text: "Federal prosecutors are investigating the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which was, until recently, helmed by major Democratic donor Sam Bankman-Fried, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter.\n\nBankman-Fried and FTX are already under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice, over reports that FTX loaned billions of dollars worth of clients\u2019 assets to Alameda Research, a trading house co-founded by Bankman-Fried. While the crypto market is still largely unregulated, the undisclosed use of clients\u2019 funds has exposed Bankman-Fried, FTX and Alameda to American embezzlement and fraud laws, prompting the Manhattan U.S. attorney\u2019s office to begin investigating, according to the WSJ. (RELATED: Crypto Billionaire And Dem Donor\u2019s $16 Billion Fortune Evaporated In A Matter Of Days: REPORT)\n\n\u201cWhat this will boil down to is, were there deliberate lies to convince depositors or investors to part with their assets?\u201d former Manhattan federal prosecutor Samson Enzer told the WSJ. \u201cWere there statements made that were false, and the maker of those statements knew they were false and made with the intent to deceive the investor?\u201d\n\nU.S. attorneys would need to establish jurisdiction over the Bahamas-based FTX, especially considering Bankman-Fried lived in the Bahamas, according to the WSJ. However, since FTX had an American arm, FTX US, and Bankman-Fried had close ties with American regulators, prosecutors may gain jurisdiction on the grounds that parts of an alleged scheme took place on U.S. soil.\n\n5) I\u2019m piecing together all of the details, but I was shocked to see things unravel the way they did earlier this week.

On the same day, the company\u2019s assets were frozen by Bahamian regulators.\n\nBoth the crypto exchange and erstwhile billionaire are also under investigation by the Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC), according to Bloomberg. Bankman-Fried donated hundreds of thousands of his own dollars to congressional candidates in the Senate and House Agriculture Committees, the congressional bodies that oversee the CTFC.\n\nHe also donated more than $27 million to the Democrat-aligned Protect Our Future PAC which in turn spent $1 million on Democratic Rep. Shontel Brown of Ohio, a member of the House Agriculture Committee. American Dream Federal Action, a political action committee founded by FTX executive Ryan Salame, spent more than $2 million combined on the Senate committee\u2019s ranking Republican Sen. John Boozman of Arkansas and Republican Rep. Brad Finstad of Minnesota, a member of the House committee.\n\nThe Second District of New York U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and FTX did not immediately respond to a Daily Caller News Foundation request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

    text: "Ilya and Nikita Nuzhin have said that their father was \"killed like an animal\" after horrific footage showed Yevgeny Nuzhin being murdered by Russian private army Wagner\n\nTraumatised sons hit out at Vladimir Putin's 'fascists' who sledgehammered dad to death\n\nThe Russian sons of a fighter bludgeoned to death \"for treachery\" have denounced the barbaric killing by a pro-Vladimir Putin mercenary army closely linked to the Russian president's defence ministry.\n\nHorrific footage, too graphic for the Mirror to show, was released showing convicted murderer Yevgeny Nuzhin, 55, being killed with a sledgehammer in an extrajudicial killing by the notorious private Russian military group, Wagner.\n\nThe convict had been released from prison to go to fight against Ukraine but then he absconded, defecting to Ukraine, and criticised Putin\u2019s war by claiming that he and others were \u201ccannon fodder\u201d.\n\nHowever, it appears Ukraine may have traded him back for possibly 20 of their own PoWs.\n\nBack in Russia, Nuzhin was evidently handed back by Putin\u2019s officials to Wagner, which is run by his close crony Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as \u201cPutin's chef\u201d.\n\nAn appalling video called Hammer of Vengeance was released by pro-Russian sources, possibly to deter in the most sickening way other defectors among Russia\u2019s convicts fighting at the front, and other mobilised men.\n\nImage: Yevgeny Nuzhin/east2west news) Yevgeny Nuzhin/east2west news)\n\nThe horrific footage showed an unidentified man appearing to attack Nuzhin with a sledgehammer as he falls to the ground and is beaten to death.\n\nSpeaking out about the killing, Nuzhin's eldest son Ilya Nuzhin, 31, said: \u201cHe was killed without a court investigation, killed like an animal.\u201d\n\nNuzhin's second son Nikita, 28, added: \u201cEven animals aren\u2019t killed like this\u2026\u201d\n\nBoth sons had served in the Russian army while their father was serving his 24-year sentence.\n\nIlya told Vladimir Osechkin, head of human rights group gulagu.net : \u201cWe are shocked - we have just seen this video today. There is no way to prepare yourself for this. We are petrified...\n\n\u201cI started watching it with my wife. She shrieked with horror and I started to shake when I saw that. The whole family cried, even those who didn\u2019t like him. The whole family cried. No-one deserves this...\n\n\u201cEven though he was a convict, he served more than 20 years. He was unarmed, a prisoner of war.\u201d\n\nIlya also blamed Ukraine for exchanging his father in the knowledge he would face reprisals for his defection, he said: \u201cThe man wanted to live, he wanted to get back to his family. [Ukrainians] you gave him away to our men.\n\nImage: Vedomosti) Vedomosti)\n\n\u201cTo those b***, who are an illegal armed formation [Wagner] who were waiting for exactly a case like this one, to execute them.\n\n\u201cI can only say one thing. Our men are fascists - but theirs are just the same.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf he was passed [in a PoW swap], then all of them, starting from the jail he was in, the colony number 3 in the Ryazan region, Prigozhin, and ending up with Putin, they all deserve the same\u2026.\n\n\u201cOur father was killed like an animal.\u201d\n\nPrigozhin has already sought to justify the killing, saying it was a \u201cdog\u2019s death to the dog\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cNuzhin betrayed his people, betrayed his comrades, betrayed consciously. He was not captured and did not surrender, but planned his escape. Nuzhin is a traitor.\u201d\n\nThe human rights group called for protection for the Nuzhin's family in Russia as the sons fear for the safety of themselves and their families amid accusations of treachery against their father.",

    text: "Afghanistan's supreme leader has ordered judges to fully enforce aspects of Islamic law that include public executions, stonings and floggings, and the amputation of limbs for thieves.\n\nTaliban chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted late on Sunday that the 'obligatory' command by Hibatullah Akhundzada came after the secretive leader met with a group of judges.\n\nAkhundzada, who has not been filmed or photographed in public since the Taliban returned to power in August last year, rules by decree from Kandahar, the movement's birthplace and spiritual heartland.\n\nThe Taliban promised a softer version of the harsh rule that characterised their first stint in power, from 1996-2001, but have gradually clamped down on rights and freedoms.\n\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid speaks during a press conference in Kabul on November 5, 2022\n\nTaliban fighters have been filmed whipping a man tied to a street sign outside the Education Ministry in Kabul in September, 2021\n\n'Carefully examine the files of thieves, kidnappers and seditionists,' Mujahid quoted Akhundzada as saying.\n\n'Those files in which all the sharia (Islamic law) conditions of hudud and qisas have been fulfilled, you are obliged to implement.\n\n'This is the ruling of sharia, and my command, which is obligatory.'\n\nMujahid was not available Monday to expand on his tweet.\n\nHudud refers to offences which, under Islamic law, certain types of punishment are mandated, while qisas translates as 'retaliation in kind' - effectively an eye for an eye.\n\nHudud crimes include adultery - and falsely accusing someone of it - drinking alcohol, theft, kidnapping and highway robbery, apostasy and rebellion.\n\nQisas covers murder and deliberate injury, among other things, but also allows for the families of victims to accept compensation in lieu of punishment.\n\nIslamic scholars say crimes leading to hudud punishment require a very high degree of proof, including - in the case of adultery - confession, or being witnessed by four adult male Muslims.\n\nTaliban members gather near the building of former United States embassy as they celebrate the first anniversary of taking over the government in Kabul, Afghanistan, on 15 August, 2022\n\nA Taliban fighter guards a street in Kabul on August 30, 2022, a day after the Taliban declared August 31, 2022, a national holiday to celebrate the first anniversary of the withdrawal of US-led troops\n\nSocial media has been awash for over a year - and even recently - with videos and pictures of Taliban fighters meting out summary floggings to people accused of various offences.\n\nThe Taliban have also several times displayed in public the bodies of kidnappers they said were killed in shootouts.\n\nThere have also been reports of adulterers being flogged in rural areas after Friday prayers, but independent verification is difficult to obtain.\n\nThe Taliban has also banned women from entering parks, funfairs, gyms and public baths\n\nTaliban fighters travel in a vehicle as they celebrate the first anniversary of the withdrawal of US-led troops from Afghanistan, near the airport in Kabul on 31 August, 2022\n\nRahima Popalzai, a legal and political analyst, said the edict could be an attempt by the Taliban to harden a reputation they may feel has softened since returning to power.\n\n'If they really start to implement hudud and qisas, they will be aiming to create the fear society has gradually lost,' she told AFP.\n\nShe added the Taliban also wanted to burnish their Islamic credentials.\n\n'As a theocratic setup, the Taliban want to strengthen their religious identity among Muslim countries.'\n\nWomen in particular have seen hard-won rights evaporate in the past 15 months, and they are increasingly being squeezed out of public life.\n\nMost female government workers have lost their jobs - or are being paid a pittance to stay at home - while women are also barred from travelling without a male relative and must cover up with a burqa or hijab when outside.\n\nIn the past week, the Taliban also banned women from entering parks, funfairs, gyms and public baths.\n\nDuring their first rule, the Taliban regularly carried out punishments in public - including floggings and executions at the national stadium.",

      "Jamtara, Giridih cyber gangs stationing recruits in small or KAVAL towns: Six cheats arrested in Prayagraj spill the beans",
    text: 'PRAYAGRAJ: After their traditional bases of Jamtara and Giridih districts of Jharkhand have come under police scanner, big cyber criminals are hiring young recruits, who live in rented accommodations in small or KAVAL (Kanpur, Agra, Varanasi, Allahabad and Lucknow) towns, open accounts in both private and government banks after changing their address on Aadhaar cards and transfer money to their \u2018bosses\u2019 once the work in done.This startling fact came to light after a joint team of Colonelganj police and Cyber crime cell of the district police on Monday arrested as many as six cybercriminals in the city. In questioning, they spilled the beans about their latest modus operandi.The cops also seized Rs 33,400 cash, one tab, six mobiles, 25-odd passbooks, 14 cheque books, 30 ATM cards, 17 Aadhaar cards, seven PAN cards, two odd bank account opening kits and 13 SIM cards from their possession.SSP (Prayagraj) Shailesh Kumar Pandey told TOI, "Six cyber criminals \u2014 Vikas Das, Rakesh Kumar Mandal, Manish Kumar Mandal, Santosh Kumar Rai , Govind Mandal and Karan Kumar Mandal \u2014 all residents of Giridih district, were arrested by a team of Colonelganj police from their rented accommodation in Chota Baghara locality of the city on Monday. They had landed in city about two months back and hired an accommodation in Chota Baghara to run their operations."After landing in Prayagraj, these six cybercriminals opened as many as 35 accounts in different banks after getting their addresses changed in their Aadhaar cards. The motive behind opening accounts in local banks was to collect duped money from gullible victims from different parts of the country and later transfer it to the main accounts of the main handlers in Giridih district, police added.The SSP added, "Once the cybercriminals manage to dupe a victim and get an amount transferred or deposited in these accounts, they take no time in withdrawing it through ATM or cheques and transferring in accounts operational in Giridih district of Jharkhand."Most of these arrested cybercriminals have studied till Vth or VIIth standard. Interestingly, the cybercriminals of Giridih and Jamtara are competing with each other.This latest modus operandi of the cybercriminals was cracked when an organiser of Jan Sewa Kendra approached the local police and claimed that his and his wife\u2019s accounts were frozen by the Hyderabad and Bengaluru police. "When the police inquired about the issue, they came to know that the cybercriminals got money transferred to the account of the Jan Sewa Kendra organiser, telling him that it was sent by their relatives. They then asked him to give him the money, which he did," the police said.When Hyderabad and Bengaluru police came to know that money of a cyber fraud victim was transferred into his account, they managed to get his and his wife\u2019s accounts frozen.The SSP said that the police have been looking for three key operatives \u2014 Sitaram Mandal, Mantoo Mandal and Pawan Mandal \u2014 all residents of Giridih for trapping youths on the pretext of providing employment in different parts of the county.The arrested cybercriminal Vikas Das, who earlier worked at a local eatery in the Sangam city, told the police that he came in contact with Sitaram Mandal in March. He inducted him into his gang after promising fast bucks and a lavish lifestyle.Vikas told the police that Sitaram Mandal and his two key associates had managed to open their accounts after changing addresses on Aadhaar cards and all the duped money was deposited in their accounts.When the cops conducted a detailed probe, they came to know that the three key operatives had opened at least 35 accounts in the name of the six cybercriminals to get the duped amount deposited. Once the amount was deposited, Vikas and his accomplice used to send this money to Giridih through ATM transfer or other methods.These criminals had recently duped Rs 1.02 lakh of a Varanasi-based man, following which an FIR under section 420 of IPC was registered with Mahuwadeeh police station of Varanasi.',
